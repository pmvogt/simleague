# TODO

- [] CDN for logo images
- [] Add a `favicon.ico` to the root of the site
- [] get data from somewhere on server, pass to client components (e.g. `<TeamSelect options={team.prettyName} />)

# Takeaways for next time

- Next time you want to start with a postgres DB from the beginning, use Docker from the jump (add docker-compose.yml, etc)
